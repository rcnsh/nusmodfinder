Append-only. Re-read this file and `docs/PLAN.md` after every compaction or new session.

## 2026-11-03 — Phase 0 start

- Initial commit `3b18041` of the working tree the live Worker runs (incl. untracked
  `0005_rank.sql` and unstaged edits). Private repo `rcnsh/vector-nusmods` created; squash-only,
  auto-delete branches.
- Deployed version `c6744373-1aff-4d8d-8b7f-6dd4e6c3d513` (deployment `9e0c69cd…`,
  2026-09-04 12:06Z) ↔ commit `3b18041`. Evidence: live `/` byte-identical to `src/page.html`.
- Pinned upstream data: release `data-2026-2027-20260904` holds the gzipped `.data/` files
  production was built from. Raw sha256 moduleInfo
  `2d138795d387d133237669a7f5a22c7c4d30b4a26bf82dad0a982636e80857b1`, moduleList
  `c56b6fbec195da856eff924a167c31b446686aebfa8ba7346a43dd12b893e36e`.
- Remote D1 schema snapshot (read-only pragma query): **estimate ~60 rows read / 0 written;
  actual 77 read / 0 written**. Saved for the rebuild diff.
- Earlier remote read for `sqlite_master` listing: 16 rows read (and one malformed query, 0).
- Workstream 0b (live + frontend reproductions) done: 36 `/search` + 7 other live calls,
  evidence in `/tmp/vnm-repro/` (to be copied into `docs/evidence/phase0/`).
- Critic incident: critic A's first experiment ran the test plugin with default
  `remoteBindings`, which made 2 Cloudflare API GETs (`/accounts`, `/memberships`). No AI,
  Vectorize or D1 call. Led to objection #2.
- Phase 0 planning loop round 1: 2 critics, 14 objections, all accepted (see PLAN.md).

## 2026-11-04 — Phase 0 workstream 0c (findings)

- `docs/FINDINGS.md` triages all 35 IDs: 30 reproduced, 3 partially-reproduced (B4, P2,
  V1), 2 fixed (O1, O2 by PR #1), 0 rejected. Each section gives the claim, the evidence
  (tests and/or `docs/evidence/phase0/` files) and the cause by file:line.
- Characterisation tests `[<ID> known-bug] …` (plain `it`, asserting the current wrong
  output) in `test/findings/`, plus `test/full/findings.test.js`. Over the full pinned
  corpus, B1 is exact: 31 sem-3 matches for `management`, lexical returns the same 6 codes
  production did. Mutation check: un-capping the FTS limit or fixing `topK=` fails the
  matching tests.
- `vitest.config.mjs` now has two projects: `workers` (as before) and `node` for
  `*.node.test.js` (Node-side `scripts/` code and repository-file checks; workerd can't load
  `node:*` without `nodejs_compat`, which production doesn't set). The workers project uses an
  extglob include rather than `exclude`, because a project-level exclude overrides the CLI's
  `--exclude 'test/full/**'`.
- `scripts/check-findings.mjs` + `npm run check:findings`, unit-tested in
  `test/check-findings.node.test.js`. CI: `.github/workflows/findings.yml` (no path filter,
  plain node, no `npm ci`).
- Live calls: none. Pinned corpus fetched from the GitHub release (not api.nusmods.com) into
  `/tmp/vnm-0c/` and `.data/` (gitignored) to run `test/full` locally.
- No change to `src/` or `scripts/lib.mjs`.

## 2026-11-04 — Phase 0 passed; Phases 1 and 2 planned

- PR #1 (harness, migrations, lint, typecheck, CI) and PR #2 (35 findings triaged: 30 reproduced,
  3 partially reproduced, 2 fixed; characterisation tests; findings CI) merged. Main CI green on
  `546a91d` (CI + Findings). Each PR went through 4 fresh-context review rounds; findings fixed
  (fake Vectorize semantics, CI path filter, B5 tests made behavioural, check-findings reads
  exact test titles from the AST).
- Phase 0 exit: CI green on main; `check-findings` OK; `db:rebuild-check` 0 differences. No
  deploy (no runtime change); production still `c6744373` ↔ `3b18041` (behaviourally = `546a91d`).
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 plans converged after 3 critic rounds each (`docs/plans/`). Key facts found:
  D1 primary is WEUR with read replication disabled (likely cause of latency for SIN users);
  indexing `code` in FTS or raising depth to 100 would change rankings; a D1 write overrun is an
  account-wide outage; a reused holdout inflates SC5's false-positive rate (simulated 14% vs 2.5%).
- Tagged `eval-v0` = `7ac9841` (ranker identical to production).

## 2026-11-04 — Phase 1 step 0: module split and instrumentation (`phase1/instrument`)

- `src/index.js` is now only the router. Search (cache, rate limiter, filters, FTS, fusion,
  hydration) is in `src/search.js`, `/module` and `/facets` in `src/modules.js`, the admin
  ingest routes in `src/ingest.js`, response helpers in `src/http.js`, spans and D1 counters in
  `src/timing.js`, and the default model id in `src/embedding.js`. 1A, 1B and 1C can now edit
  different files.
- Behaviour-neutral: every Phase 0 test passes unchanged except three. `[B4 known-bug] responses
  carry no Server-Timing header` is flipped to `[B4 instrumented] …`. Two source-text tests (O3,
  S1) now read all of `src/*.js` instead of `src/index.js`, and the README's `NG_LIST_UPDATED`
  pointer moved to `src/modules.js`. A throwaway differential test ran the old `index.js` and the
  new router side by side on 31 paths (errors, every filter, every mode, admin 404) and got
  identical status, headers (minus the two new ones) and bodies.
- `/search` responses carry `Server-Timing` (`cache;desc=hit|miss`, `limit`, `pin`, `embed`,
  `vector`, `fts`, `hydrate`, `total` from fetch entry, only stages that ran). Cache hits get fresh
  spans, and the stored entry never holds any. `/module` and `/facets` have `d1` and `total`.
  Each `/search` writes one JSON log line: status, cache, q (first 100 chars), q length, mode,
  filters, topK, counts, spans, D1 queries/rows read/served_by_region/served_by_primary, colo,
  version. Headers and IPs are not logged.
- `version_metadata` binding (`CF_VERSION_METADATA`); every response has `x-app-version` (tag,
  else version id, else `dev`); `GET /health` → `{ ok, versionId, versionTag }`, no D1.
- `npm run deploy` → `scripts/deploy.mjs`: refuses a dirty tree, an unfetchable origin, or a HEAD
  not on `origin/main`; runs `wrangler deploy --tag <short sha> --message "<sha> <subject>"`;
  prints the version id. Not run. Plain `wrangler deploy` still works; the README says
  `npm run deploy` is the only supported path.
- Tests 98 → 117 (`test/instrument.test.js`, `test/deploy.node.test.js`). No live calls, no
  remote commands, no deploy.

## 2026-11-04 — Phase 1/2 in flight

- PR #4 (module split + Server-Timing, structured logs, version_metadata, guarded `npm run deploy`)
  and PR #5 (lexical retriever moved to `src/lexical.js`, takes a D1 handle) merged. **Not deployed**:
  the brief allows deploys only after a phase passes its exit criteria, so the plan's "instrumentation
  deploy first" step is replaced by a read-only analytics baseline (below).
- **Production baseline** (GraphQL `workersInvocationsAdaptive`, script `vector-nusmods`,
  2026-10-28..2026-11-04, all routes, 225 successful requests incl. our Phase 0 probes): wall time
  p50 **279 ms**, p90 1,017 ms, p99 1,886 ms; CPU p50 4.3 ms, **p99 18.5 ms** (above the nominal
  10 ms Free limit, with 0 errors). 2 `scriptThrewException` = our B5 probes. Per-span numbers come
  with the Phase 1 deploy.
- Phase 2 2b: 147 persona queries (6 writer subagents, no corpus/tool access; prompts and seeded
  shape quotas in `eval/v2/`) + 18 mechanical code queries + 15 noise-model typos = 180. Split
  provenance-first, TF-IDF topic clusters (single-link, threshold 0.35 = lowest of 0.30–0.50 giving
  every shape ≥ 2 per split): **dev 99 / holdout 81**. Dev sha256 `cf33e601…bc3b4`; holdout plaintext
  sha256 `8f653595…f7bdb4` held by the custodian (lead) in `~/.config/vnm/custody/`, to be committed
  only encrypted. Deviation: TF-IDF instead of embedding similarity for clustering (embedding tool
  not ready); recorded for ADR 0003.
- Running: 2a eval harness, 1A (0006 + exact filtered lexical), 1B (request path).
